The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly with percentages and other units.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works as expected. However, `width: calc(50% - 10%);` will not work as intended and might result in unexpected behaviour or no effect. Percentages inside `calc()` are relative to the containing element's size, and subtracting percentages from percentages can cause calculation issues.  Another issue could be using `calc()` with units that are not compatible, such as mixing `em` and `px` without proper conversion resulting in unexpected output.
